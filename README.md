# ProteinBlaster
This python code use genome contig and blast 6 frames of possible amino acids sequence to find the real protein sequence by NCBI BLAST

This code use Bio Python library for doing some bioinformatics data analysis.

Protein Blaster use FastA contig file to make 6 frame probable amino acid chains. after that all of these amino acids would be blast by NCBI Protein blast (PBLAST) to find right protein based on minimum E Value. 

Protein Blaster Main features:

1. generate and report all 6 frame posibble protein (amino acids) sequence from every contig and save it to a FASTA format file.
2. Bastp online through NCBI API
3. Modify E Value to find the right real protein.
4. Limit the number of contigs that you want to examine in every run of the program.
